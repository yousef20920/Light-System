### **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration**

#### **1. WiFi Setup**
Edit `src/main.cpp` and update these lines:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

#### **2. IFTTT Integration**
1. Create account at [IFTTT.com](https://ifttt.com)
2. Create two applets:
   - **Room Occupied**: Webhooks ‚Üí Smart Device On
   - **Room Empty**: Webhooks ‚Üí Smart Device Off
3. Get webhook URLs and update in code:
```cpp
const char* ifttt_webhook_occupied = "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/room_occupied/with/key/YOUR_KEY";
const char* ifttt_webhook_empty = "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/room_empty/with/key/YOUR_KEY";
```

#### **3. Alexa Integration via IFTTT**
1. In IFTTT, connect Webhooks to Amazon Alexa
2. Set up voice commands:
   - "Alexa, turn on room lights" ‚Üí Triggers when room occupied
   - "Alexa, turn off room lights" ‚Üí Triggers when room empty

### **üöÄ Deployment & Internet Access**

#### **Option 1: Local Network Access**
- Access dashboard via ESP32's IP address (shown on LCD)
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100`

#### **Option 2: Internet Deployment via ngrok**
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Download from: https://ngrok.com

# Create tunnel to ESP32
ngrok http 192.168.1.100:80

# Use provided ngrok URL for remote access
```

#### **Option 3: Cloud Deployment (Advanced)**
- Use services like Blynk, ThingSpeak, or AWS IoT
- Forward data to cloud dashboard for global access

### **üîß How It Works**

#### **Dual Sensor Logic**
1. **Sensor 1** (Entrance): Positioned at room entrance
2. **Sensor 2** (Exit): Positioned inside room, near entrance
3. **Entry Detection**: Person triggers Sensor 1, then Sensor 2
4. **Exit Detection**: Person triggers Sensor 2, then Sensor 1
5. **Occupant Counting**: System maintains accurate count of people in room

#### **Smart Features**
- **Automatic Light Control**: Lights turn on/off based on actual occupancy
- **Energy Calculation**: Tracks power savings from automated control
- **False Trigger Prevention**: Timeout logic prevents sensor noise issues
- **Web Interface**: Real-time dashboard for monitoring and analytics

- "Alexa, turn off room lights" 
- "Alexa, what's the room status?"

#### **Expandability**
- Add more sensors for multiple rooms
- Integrate with smart thermostats
- Connect to security systems
- Add mobile app notifications

### **üìà Analytics & Insights**

The system provides valuable insights into:
- **Energy Efficiency**: How much electricity you're saving
- **Room Usage Patterns**: When and how long the room is occupied
- **Cost Savings**: Monetary value of automated lighting control
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and connectivity metrics

### **üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**
1. **WiFi Connection Failed**
   - Check SSID and password in code
   - Ensure 2.4GHz WiFi (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)

2. **Sensors Not Detecting**
   - Verify wiring connections
   - Check sensor placement (avoid obstacles)
   - Adjust `SENSOR_THRESHOLD` value in code

3. **Dashboard Not Loading**
   - Check ESP32 IP address on LCD
   - Ensure devices on same network
   - Restart ESP32 if needed

4. **IFTTT Not Triggering**
   - Verify webhook URLs in code
   - Test webhooks directly in browser
   - Check IFTTT applet configuration

### **üîÆ Future Enhancements**
- Mobile app for iOS/Android
- Machine learning for occupancy prediction
- Integration with additional smart home platforms
- Historical data export and advanced analytics
- Multiple room support with centralized dashboard
